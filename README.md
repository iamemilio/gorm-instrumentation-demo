# GORM Examples

This project contains examples of how to integrate and instrument GORM applications using the New Relic Go agent. The [basic-gorm-app](basic-gorm-app) is a simple one shot application that shows you how to instrument a very simple GORM application. The [gorm-http-app](gorm-http-app) is a more complex example that displays some best practices and design patterns that can be used to instrument a GORM HTTP application.
